## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned how to use grid, and how to apply the background images that are cropping outside the
viewport.

### Continued development

Would like to work with designer with all responsive designs (e.g. this one is looking great on
1440px, but it is hard to get it working on 1024px with the desktop layout)
